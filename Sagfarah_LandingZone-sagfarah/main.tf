Unfortunately I do not have enough context to generate full Terraform configurations. However, I can offer a few general suggestions for best practices when writing Terraform code:

- Use modules to encapsulate and reuse resource configurations. For example, create separate modules for EC2, S3, RDS resources.

- Follow the principle of least privilege when configuring IAM roles and permissions. Grant only the minimum permissions needed.

- Add comments to explain the architecture and purpose of modules, resources, etc. Document your code.

- Use variables and outputs for reusable, configurable components. Define input variables for things like VPC IDs, subnet IDs, etc. and output values that other modules may need.

- Have default values for variables where possible, for simplicity.

- Validate input variables where feasible to prevent errors.

- Use Terraform remote state to share state across modules and reduce duplication.

- Organize code into logical files and directories, such as main.tf, variables.tf, outputs.tf.

Without more specific requirements I cannot generate full configurations. I'd be happy to provide examples or templates if given more details on the desired architecture and AWS services needed. Please let me know if you have any other questions!
