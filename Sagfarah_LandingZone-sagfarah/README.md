Here is a detailed README for a Terraform configuration using EC2, S3, RDS, and IAM AWS services:

# Terraform AWS Infrastructure

## Overview

This Terraform configuration sets up the following AWS infrastructure:

- EC2 instance for hosting applications
- S3 bucket for storing files
- RDS PostgreSQL database instance 
- IAM roles and policies to manage access controls

It follows security best practices and cost optimization tips aligned to the [AWS Well-Architected Framework](https://aws.amazon.com/architecture/well-architected/).

## Security

- EC2 instance runs in a private subnet with no public IP, only accessible through a bastion host
- RDS database is in a private subnet with security group limiting access 
- S3 bucket access controlled using IAM policies and bucket policies
- IAM roles and groups used to assign least privilege permissions

## Cost Optimization

- EC2 instance type and RDS instance sized appropriately to workload requirements
- EC2 instance usage can be optimized by using auto-scaling and spot instances
- S3 storage classes optimized based on access patterns
- CloudWatch alarms configured to notify on cost thresholds
