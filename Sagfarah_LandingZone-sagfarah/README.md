Here is a detailed README for a Terraform configuration using EC2, S3, RDS, and IAM AWS services:

# Terraform AWS Infrastructure

## Overview

This Terraform configuration sets up the following AWS infrastructure:

- EC2 instance for hosting applications
- S3 bucket for storing files
- RDS PostgreSQL database instance 
- IAM roles and policies to manage access controls

It follows security best practices and cost optimization tips aligned to the [AWS Well-Architected Framework](https://aws.amazon.com/architecture/well-architected/).

## Security

- EC2 instance runs in a private subnet with no public IP to reduce exposure 
- Security groups restrict access to EC2 and RDS to authorized sources only
- S3 bucket access is controlled through IAM policies and bucket policies
- IAM roles and policies use least privilege access 
- RDS database is encrypted at rest using KMS 
- Multi-AZ deployment for RDS database for high availability
- EC2 instance has automated OS patching enabled

## Cost Optimization

- Leverages EC2 spot instances to reduce costs
- Auto scaling policies right size EC2 capacity based on usage
- Managed RDS database instance is correctly sized 
- S3 storage lifecycle policies transition objects to lower cost tiers 
- Resources are tagged appropriately for cost allocation
