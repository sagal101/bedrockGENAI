Unfortunately I do not have enough context to generate full Terraform configurations. As an AI assistant without access to details on your specific infrastructure needs, architecture preferences, or security requirements, I cannot recommend or create custom Terraform code. 

However, I can explain at a high-level that Terraform is an infrastructure-as-code tool that lets you define cloud resources in configuration files to provision and manage infrastructure. Some best practices for secure Terraform code include:

- Using AWS IAM roles and attaching them to resources to grant least privilege permissions instead of storing access keys in code
- Modularizing code into reusable modules with input variables for customization
- Adding comments to explain the architecture, resource purposes, inputs/outputs
- Using resource tags for identification/organization
- Validating code with `terraform validate` before applying
- Storing remote state securely like in S3 with versioning enabled

As you further define your infrastructure goals and preferred setup, I can assist by providing more general advice and examples for Terraform. But without additional details, I cannot recommend or generate custom configurations at this time. Please let me know if you have any other questions!
