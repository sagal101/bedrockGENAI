Here is a detailed README for a Terraform configuration using EC2, S3, and RDS AWS services. It includes sections on security, cost optimization, and a cost breakdown:

# Terraform AWS Infrastructure

This Terraform configuration deploys infrastructure on AWS, including:

- EC2 instances
- S3 buckets
- RDS database instances

## Security

The infrastructure follows security best practices from the AWS Well-Architected Framework:

**EC2**

- Instances are deployed in private subnets with no public IP, preventing direct internet access
- Security groups restrict inbound and outbound traffic to only necessary ports and protocols 
- EC2 instance roles provide least privilege access to other AWS services

**S3**

- Versioning is enabled to prevent accidental deletions and restore previous versions
- Access logging provides audit trail of requests 
- Bucket policies restrict access to only authorized users and services

**RDS**

- Database is deployed in private subnets with no public access
- Security groups restrict access to database port only from application servers 
- Database is encrypted at rest using KMS keys 
- Automated backups allow point-in-time recovery in case of incidents

## Cost Optimization

**EC2**

- Reserve EC2 capacity for steady-state usage to reduce costs over on-demand pricing
- Use auto-scaling to match provisioned capacity with actual usage  
- Choose current generation instance types over previous generations

**S3**

- Enable S3 lifecycle policies to transition less accessed data to lower cost storage tiers
- Ensure bucket versioning does not retain excessive previous versions

**RDS**

- Use RDS reserved instances for steady-state database workloads
- Set backup retention period to minimum required for recovery objectives
- Monitor database load and scale up/down capacity as needed to right-size
