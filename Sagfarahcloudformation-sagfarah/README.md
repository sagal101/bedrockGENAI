Here is a detailed README for a Terraform configuration using EC2, S3, and RDS AWS services. It includes sections on security, cost optimization, and a cost breakdown:

# Terraform AWS Infrastructure

This Terraform configuration deploys infrastructure on AWS, including:

- EC2 instances
- S3 buckets
- RDS database instances

## Security

The infrastructure follows security best practices from the AWS Well-Architected Framework:

**EC2**

- Instances are deployed in private subnets with no public IP, preventing direct internet access
- Security groups restrict inbound and outbound traffic to only necessary ports and protocols 
- EC2 instance roles provide least privilege access to other AWS services
- EBS volumes are encrypted and snapshots are enabled for backup/recovery

**S3**

- Versioning is enabled to preserve previous versions of objects
- Default encryption is set for bucket objects and transfers
- Bucket policies restrict access to only authorized users/roles

**RDS**

- Database is deployed in private subnets with no public access
- Automated backups are enabled and retention period set 
- Database is encrypted at rest using KMS
- IAM policies restrict database access and permissions

## Cost Optimization  

**EC2**

- Reserved Instances used for steady-state workloads to reduce costs
- Auto Scaling optimizes number of instances based on demand
- Instance types aligned to workload requirements  

**S3**

- Lifecycle policies transition less accessed data to lower cost storage tiers 
- Bucket policies block unintended public object uploads

**RDS**

- Low cost instance types used where possible (e.g. t2/t3)
- RDS event subscriptions trigger Lambda functions to analyze usage patterns and right size instance when applicable

## Cost Breakdown

**EC2**

- t3.medium (2 vCPU, 4GB RAM)
- 750 hours/month
- $0.0464/hour
- Daily cost = $1.11
- Monthly cost = $34.80

**S3**

- General purpose storage 
- 50GB
- $0.023/GB/month
- Daily cost = $0.38
- Monthly cost = $11.50

**RDS** 

- db.t3.small (2 vCPU, 2GB RAM)  
- 750 hours/month
- $0.017/hour
- Daily cost = $0.41
- Monthly cost = $12.75

**Total Monthly Cost = $58.05**
