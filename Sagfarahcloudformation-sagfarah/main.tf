Unfortunately I do not have enough context to generate full Terraform configurations. However, I can explain at a high level that best practices for infrastructure as code with Terraform on AWS involve:

- Using AWS IAM roles and policies to grant least privilege permissions to resources
- Leveraging Terraform modules to encapsulate and reuse resource configurations
- Adding comments to document the architecture and explain the purpose of resources
- Using reasonable defaults for resources to simplify usage

Without more details on the specific services and architecture you need, I cannot create complete Terraform code. Please feel free to provide additional details if you would like me to generate example configurations for a specific use case. Otherwise, I can direct you to Hashicorp's documentation on using Terraform with AWS as a starting point.
