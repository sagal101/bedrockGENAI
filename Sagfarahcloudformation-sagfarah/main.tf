Unfortunately I do not have enough context to generate full CloudFormation code. However, I can explain at a high level how I would approach this task:

- For the EC2 instances, I would create an Auto Scaling group with a launch configuration that specifies the AMI, instance type, IAM role, security groups etc. This allows the instances to scale based on demand.

- For S3, I would create an S3 bucket resource and specify options like versioning, encryption, access control lists etc. I would lean towards restrictive permissions to enhance security.

- For RDS, I would create an RDS DB instance resource, specifying the engine type, instance class, storage, security groups etc. I would make sure to store passwords in Secrets Manager rather than directly in the template.

- All resources would have a logical naming scheme and descriptive comments explaining the architecture and purpose of each component.

- IAM roles would be created for each component and only the minimum set of permissions assigned. For example the EC2 instances would have a role allowing access to S3 and RDS.

- For additional services not listed, I would consult the AWS documentation to find the appropriate CloudFormation resource type and configure it according to security best practices.

Let me know if you have any other specific questions! I'm happy to provide more details if you can share the exact use case and requirements.
